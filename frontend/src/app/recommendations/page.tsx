              <p className="text-base mt-1">
                The system analyzes your Steam games, taking into account your playtime and your preferences (likes/dislikes) in this app. It uses machine learning to find games similar to those you&apos;ve played, but also considers popularity, reviews, and developer diversity.

                <li>Diversity â€” the system avoids recommending too many games from the same developer</li>

              <p className="text-base mt-1">
                The system builds your profile based on the games you&apos;ve played and your preferences. It learns from this data and predicts which new games you might enjoy by comparing their features to your favorite games.

              <span className="text-lg font-semibold">Why is it important to like or dislike games?</span>
              <p className="text-base mt-1">
                Your ratings help the system better understand your tastes. Liking a game boosts recommendations for similar games, while disliking reduces the chance of similar products appearing in your queue.

              <p className="text-base mt-1">
                Yes, the system takes into account the ratio of positive to negative reviews, as well as the overall popularity of a game, to recommend high-quality and interesting products.
